#A Data-Driven Journey Across Space and Time
##Working Title: Interdisciplinary Laboratory Excercises for Data Science with Emphasis on Spatial and Temporal Dimensions

Data science is pervasive throughout our lives. The extent to which we rely on data far exceeds the number of people with the requisite toolset to understand and produce value from it.  As such, we are redesigning an introductory data science course at the College of William and Mary to equip freshman with ideas and skills they can implement in our data-driven lives and pursuits.
